1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

A 1v1 trading card game where players summon creatures, manage mana, and battle
to reduce their opponent's life to zero.

================================================================================
2. SETUP & MULLIGAN
================================================================================

STARTING CONDITIONS:
- Each player starts with 30 life
- Each player draws 5 cards
- Fields start empty, mana pools start empty

MULLIGAN PHASE:
Before the game begins, each player may choose to:
  - KEEP their hand, or
  - MULLIGAN (shuffle hand back into deck and draw 5 new cards)

Each player gets ONE mulligan decision. The game starts after both players
have decided.

================================================================================
3. TURN STRUCTURE
================================================================================

On your turn, you may (in any order):
  1. Play lands (max 1 per turn)
  2. Tap lands for mana
  3. Play creatures/spells using mana
  4. Declare attacks with your creatures
  5. End your turn

AT END OF TURN:
  - Creatures with Vigilance untap

AT START OF YOUR NEXT TURN:
  - All your cards untap
  - Summoning sickness clears from your creatures
  - Your mana pool empties
  - Draw at least 1 card (draw up to 5 if hand is smaller)

================================================================================
4. MANA SYSTEM
================================================================================

MANA TYPES:
  White, Blue, Black, Red, Green, Colorless

GENERATING MANA:

  Option 1 - TAP A LAND ON YOUR FIELD:
    Click a land you've played to tap it. Its mana is added to your pool.

  Option 2 - BURN A LAND FROM YOUR HAND:
    Discard a land card from your hand to add its mana to your pool.
    (The land goes to your discard pile)

SPENDING MANA:
  - Colored costs (White, Blue, etc.) must be paid with that exact color
  - Colorless costs can be paid with any color of mana
  - Unspent mana is lost at the start of your next turn

================================================================================
5. PLAYING CARDS
================================================================================

LANDS:
  - Free to play (no mana cost)
  - Maximum 1 land per turn
  - Enter the field untapped
  - Tap to produce mana

CREATURES:
  - Pay the mana cost shown on the card
  - Enter the field with full health and untapped
  - Have SUMMONING SICKNESS - cannot attack the turn they're played
    (unless they have Haste)

================================================================================
6. COMBAT
================================================================================

STEP 1 - DECLARE ATTACKS:
  - Click "Combat" to enter combat mode
  - Select your untapped creatures (without summoning sickness) to attack
  - Choose targets: the opponent OR one of their creatures
  - Attacking creatures become tapped
  - Click "Confirm Attacks"

STEP 2 - DECLARE BLOCKERS (Defender):
  - The defending player chooses which of their untapped creatures block
  - Select a blocker, then click the attacker it will block
  - Flying creatures can only be blocked by creatures with Flying or Reach
  - Click "Confirm Blockers" or "No Blockers"

STEP 3 - DAMAGE RESOLUTION:

  UNBLOCKED ATTACKS:
    - vs Player: Defender loses life equal to attacker's Attack
    - vs Creature: Both creatures deal damage to each other simultaneously

  BLOCKED ATTACKS:
    - Attacker and blocker deal damage to each other simultaneously
    - A creature dies when its health reaches 0 or below

  FIRST STRIKE:
    - Creatures with First Strike deal damage BEFORE normal creatures
    - If First Strike damage kills the opponent, they don't hit back

  DOUBLE STRIKE:
    - Deals damage in BOTH the First Strike phase AND normal phase
    - Effectively hits twice if it survives

  TRAMPLE:
    - Excess damage (beyond what kills the blocker) hits the original target
